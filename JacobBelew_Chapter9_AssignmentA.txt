Program Description: 
Create a BankAcct Class that contains at least the following state information: name, account number, amount and interest rate. In addition to an __init__ method, the class should support methods for adjusting the interest rate, for withdrawing and depositing, and for giving a balance. You should also include a method to calculate the interest based on the number of days. Use the __str__ method to display balances and interest amounts. Create a test function to test the different methods in the BankAcct Class. 

The class and test function should be in one .py file.
